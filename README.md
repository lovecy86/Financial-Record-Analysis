## **Overview**
This Python script analyzes financial records for a company using the budget_data.csv dataset, which contains two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The script calculates key financial metrics, including the total number of months, net total profits/losses, average change in profits/losses, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits with their corresponding dates. This tool automates financial analysis, providing clear and actionable insights for business decision-making.

* What is the average monthly change in profits/loses?
* What was the greatest increase in profits over the entire period, including the date and amount?
* What was the greatest decrease in profits over the entire period, including the date and time?

## **Prerequisites**
* Python 3.x installed.
* The budget_data.csv dataset, which includes two columns:
    * Date: The date of the financial record.
    * Profit/Losses: The profit or loss amount for that month (integer).
* Basic knowledge of running Python scripts from the command line or an IDE.
